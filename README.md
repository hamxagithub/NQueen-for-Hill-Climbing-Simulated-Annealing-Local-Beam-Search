# 🧠 8-Queens Problem Using Local Search

This project demonstrates how to solve the classic **8-Queens Problem** using local search algorithms. The goal is to place 8 queens on an 8×8 chessboard so that no two queens threaten each other.

## 🔍 Implemented Algorithms

We have implemented and visualized the following **local search** techniques:

1. **Hill Climbing**
2. **Simulated Annealing**
3. **Local Beam Search**

Each algorithm attempts to minimize the number of conflicts between queens and find a solution where no queens attack each other.

## 🧰 Features

- 🔄 **Step-by-step visualization** showing how queens move during the search.
- 🧠 **Graphical Interface** using provided boilerplate, enhanced for clarity and interaction.
- 📉 **Conflict minimization** logic to guide each algorithm’s search path.
- 📊 **Comparative Analysis** to evaluate the performance of all three approaches.
- ✅ **Final board display** when a solution is successfully found.

## 🧪 Comparative Analysis

The analysis section covers insights into each technique’s behavior:

- 🕒 **Performance**: Which algorithm finds the solution fastest?
- 🎲 **Randomness Impact**: How Simulated Annealing’s randomness affects convergence.
- 👁️ **Visualization Insight**: Understanding how queens shift and how local optima are handled.
- 🔄 **Escape from Local Optima**: Which method is more robust and why.

## 🏁 Output

Each algorithm:
- Starts from a random configuration.
- Shows queen movements in real-time.
- Ends with a conflict-free board (if successful).
- Displays key statistics (steps taken, restarts, etc.).
